This question has been taken from ;- https://prepinsta.com/tcs-codevita/c-code-for-consecutive-prime-sum/

Question â€“ :  Some prime numbers can be expressed as a sum of other consecutive prime numbers.

For example
5 = 2 + 3,
17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7,
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.
Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.
Write code to find out the number of prime numbers that satisfy the above-mentioned property in a given range.

Input Format: First line contains a number N

Output Format: Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less than or equal to N.

Constraints: 2<N<=12,000,000,000

S.no	Input	Output	Comment
1	     20	      2	(Below 20 there are two such members; 5 and 17) 5=2+3 17=2+3+65+7
2	     15	      1
